# Personal Page

The intention of this simple landing page is to direct people who may be interested in what I can do to projects that demonstrate my skills. The page itself is written mainly using TypeScript and styled components using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)'s TypeScript starter.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## To Dos

- Make interaction a little more interesting
- move to SSR just for kicks.

## Built With

N.B. Apart from Styled-Components, the below all came nicely packaged in Create React App.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The web framework used
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) - for strong typing
- [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) - CSS in Js
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - Test framework
- [Testing-Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) - for testing React components
